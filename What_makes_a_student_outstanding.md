| Characteristic | Disappointing Student | Mediocre Student | Outstanding Student |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work attitude** | Avoids the advisor and tries to run out the clock. | Completes chores and waits for the advisor to decide when graduation is possible. | Considers research their main job and takes full responsibility for progress. |
| **Work habits** | Frequently unavailable during core hours; often leaves tasks unfinished or delayed. | Has a **rigid "9 to 5" view** of research; arrives late, surfs the web, and takes long breaks; takes **shortcuts** on experiments to save time. | **Uses time efficiently** and works hours as needed; ensures all work meets the **highest standards**; **proactively initiates** research tasks. |
| **Journal reading** | **Rarely reads** the literature unless repeatedly reminded; lacks awareness of relevant work in the field. | Only reads articles that are **provided by the advisor**. | **Actively and continuously** performs independent literature searches to find relevant journal articles. |
| **Research hypothesis** | Waits passively for direction and avoids examining obtained data. | Is content to work only on the **hypotheses developed by the advisor**. | **Independently assesses data** and formulates original ideas. |
| **Lab notebooks** | Keeps **incomplete or poorly organized** records; missing key parameters, dates, or observations. | Takes only general notes at the time. | Provides **detailed, step-by-step descriptions** and observations so that any other researcher can understand and reproduce the work. |
| **Writing** | Avoids writing; submits drafts **late or far below expected quality**, even after feedback. | Only writes when **forced to do so** by the advisor. | **Continually writes**, maintaining updated literature reviews, reports, protocols, and drafts. |
| **Publication** | Shows **little interest** in publishing; resists revision and underestimates the effort required for publishable work. | Views publication as an **afterthought**; puts in minor effort and expects the advisor to rework mediocre manuscripts or theses. | Recognizes that publication is **paramount** for research work; puts in heavy effort to develop manuscripts and **proactively approaches the advisor** with new publication ideas. |
| **Problem solving** | Becomes **stuck easily** and stops progress; waits for explicit instructions before taking action. | Seeks solutions from the advisor for **every hurdle**; views research as small steps guided entirely by the advisor. | Views research problems as an **opportunity to grow**; develops and tests potential solutions independently before discussing them with the advisor. |
| **Teamwork** | Minimally engaged with the group; avoids shared responsibilities and offers little support to others. | Focuses **solely on their own research** and does not help with general lab chores. | Understands that **team success drives personal success**; willingly helps others with their projects and mundane lab tasks. |
| **Weekly meetings** | Frequently **unprepared or absent**; unable to clearly explain progress or next steps. | Attends meetings but provides **limited updates** and relies heavily on direction. | Comes **well-prepared** with clear progress, data, and specific questions; drives productive discussion. |
| **Group presentations** | Delivers **poorly organized** presentations with unclear motivation, methods, or conclusions. | Presents required material adequately but with **limited insight or engagement**. | Gives **clear, structured, and insightful** presentations that stimulate discussion and feedback. |
| **Conferences / seminars** | Rarely attends; shows **low engagement** and does not follow up on learning opportunities. | Attends when required but participates **passively**. | Actively attends, asks questions, networks, and **uses conferences to shape research direction**. |
| **Engagement & communication** | Does not read emails and hopes issues will be forgotten; avoids follow-up. | Reads emails but expects **immediate responses** via LINE or messages; communication is poorly structured. | Understands the advisor has multiple responsibilities; communicates **clearly and concisely**, sets context, and follows up appropriately. |
| **Graduation** | Does not graduate until the **complete thesis is submitted and fully satisfactory**; delays are expected if progress is insufficient. | May **not graduate on time** due to incomplete research output. | Graduates **on time or early** with a strong thesis and publication record. |
| **Funding** | Funding or salary may be **reduced or discontinued**. | Retains **baseline funding**. | May receive **additional support**, travel funding, or extended funding based on performance. |
| **Letters of recommendation** | Advisor does **not provide letters** if performance and professionalism are insufficient. | Receives an **honest letter** that may discuss limitations and areas for improvement. | Receives **strong advocacy**, networking support, and active help with applications. |
