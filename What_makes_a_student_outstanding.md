| Characteristic | Mediocre Student | Outstanding Student |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work habits** | Has a **rigid "9 to 5" view** of research and is unwilling to work evenings or weekends; arrives late, surfs the web, and takes long breaks; takes **shortcuts** on experiments to save time. | **Uses time efficiently** and works non-standard hours as needed; ensures all work meets the **highest standards**; **proactively initiates** research tasks. |
| **Journal reading** | Only reads articles that are **provided by the advisor** or other students. | **Actively and continuously** performs independent literature searches to find relevant journal articles. |
| **Research hypothesis** | Is content to work only on the **hypotheses developed by the advisor** or others. | **Independently assesses data** and formulates original hypotheses based on observed phenomena. |
| **Lab notebooks** | Takes only general notes, treating the notebook more like a **personal research diary**. | Provides **detailed, step-by-step descriptions** and observations so that any other researcher can understand and reproduce the work. |
| **Writing** | Only writes when **forced to do so** by the advisor. | **Continually writes**, maintaining updated literature reviews, reports, publications, and research protocols. |
| **Publication** | Views publication as an **afterthought**; puts in minor effort and expects the advisor to rework mediocre manuscripts or theses. | Recognizes that publication is **paramount** for PhD work; puts in heavy effort to develop manuscripts and **proactively approaches the advisor** with new publication ideas. |
| **Problem solving** | Seeks solutions from the advisor for **every hurdle**; views research as small steps guided entirely by the advisor. | Views research problems as an **opportunity to grow**; develops and tests potential solutions independently before discussing them with the advisor. |
| **Teamwork** | Focuses **solely on their own research** and does not help with general lab or field chores. | Understands that **team success drives personal success**; willingly helps others with their projects and mundane lab tasks. |
