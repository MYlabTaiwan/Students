*1. Ownership and Intellectual Independence*
• You must take full ownership over your educational and research experience, accepting responsibility for both the successes and the failures of your work.
• You are expected to become increasingly independent as you progress through your degree, relying less on direct supervision and making your own decisions about what you can achieve alone versus where you need help.
• You must strive to become the world’s leading expert on your specific research question, eventually possessing knowledge that exceeds that of your advisor.
• You should independently assess your data and formulate original hypotheses rather than relying solely on those provided by your advisor.
*2. Professional Commitment and Effort*
• You must treat your research as a professional, full-time job rather than just "school".
• You are expected to put in the effort consistent with a 40–60 hour work week, depending on your program stage and funding requirements.
• You must make research a higher priority than coursework, as excellence in graduate school is defined by your research output rather than your grades.
• You should maintain an active presence in the lab or office to facilitate the exchange of ideas and serve as a resource for your colleagues.
• You must be willing to work non-standard hours, including evenings and weekends, when required to complete experiments or meet deadlines.
*3. Proactivity and Problem-Solving*
• You must proactively initiate research and literature searches rather than waiting for instructions.
• If you hit a dead end, you must not "stay stuck" for more than 24 hours; reach out to the PI, your peers, or the literature to find a way forward.
• You should view research hurdles as opportunities to grow, attempting to develop potential solutions independently before discussing them with your advisor.
• You must make reading the literature a daily habit to stay current with modern developments and appreciate how your field is evolving.
*4. Ethical Conduct and Scientific Integrity*
• You must uphold the highest level of scientific integrity; there is zero tolerance for plagiarism, the fabrication of data, or the misrepresentation of findings.
• You must be transparent and honest in your reporting, disclosing only findings that you have carefully validated.
• You must prioritize safety at all times, wearing required personal protective equipment (PPE) and following all established environmental health and safety protocols.
• You should never cut corners on experiments or field preparation to save time.
*5. Collaboration and Group Culture*
• You must treat all group members with respect, fostering a supportive and welcoming environment regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or background.
• You should view your lab mates as colleagues, not competitors, understanding that the collective success of the group drives your own personal success.
• You are expected to foster a "culture of tolerating ignorance," where everyone feels safe to admit what they do not know without fear of judgment.
• You must contribute to the general upkeep of the lab, including mundane chores and administrative duties.
*6. Communication and Reliability*
• You must provide regular progress reports (weekly or semi-monthly) detailing your work and upcoming milestones.
• You must follow through on all commitments and show up for meetings on time; punctuality is a sign of respect for others.
• You should be responsive to work-related inquiries and provide your supervisor with ready access to all assigned work products.
• You must meaningfully engage with constructive feedback, responding to suggestions in a timely fashion even if you do not follow every single piece of advice.
